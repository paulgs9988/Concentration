Concentration Game by Paul Sullivan

Description:
This project is an initial attempt at learning Swift and the Xcode environment for mobile development for iPhones. It is a basic "Concentration"
game where the user tries to pick a card and find its match. The game is still very much in its early development and I plan to continue to develop it 
going forward.

Installation
Currently, to use this program, the user must clone/pull the project from Github and run it using Xcode. A simulation can be made using Xcode's simulator
and the game is being developed using an iPhone X as the simulation.

Usage:
The program works pretty easily and the game can be played in either portrait or landscape mode. The user clicks on cards and tries to match emojis on cards.
Currently the number of card flips is tabulated and displayed on the bottom of the screen, and going forward, a scoring system will be developed where
this flip count will help determine the score along with other factors.

Support:
For any questions or for issues relating to this program, please email Paul at psullivan4467@eagle.fgcu.edu

Roadmap:
There are many obvious improvements and additions that will be made to this program, including but not limited to the following:
-Enhancement of User Interface aesthetics
-An easy way for the user to change the "theme" of the game by creating more emoji "dictionaries" (i.e. a Halloween theme, a Christmas Theme, etc) and associating
 card color and background with each theme.
-A scoring system will be added to the game 
-Different difficulty levels will be established where each level of difficulty will have more or less cards to make the game more difficult or easy.
